#Sims Backupper
This program (when compiled for Windows) will create a backup of The Sims(r) 4 save data if saved in the default location, as well as restore it if things go awry in the game.
There is a secondary function that backs up all game files (around 18 gb worth of data) so that if the game is uninstalled you don't have to redownload the whole thing, so it's a tradeoff of time vs storage available. 
Requires admin privileges.
All files will be backed up to C:\SimsBackupper
